Load and preview the dataset. Show the first 10 rows and check column data types.

Check for missing values in each column and calculate the percentage of missing data.

Convert Year & Month into a datetime column named date.

Get summary statistics (.describe()) for numeric columns like magnitude, depth, cdi, mmi, sig, etc.

Find correlation among numerical features and visualize it using a seaborn heatmap.

Check data range: What are the minimum and maximum values of magnitude, depth, and sig?

Detect outliers in magnitude and depth using a boxplot.

🔹 Magnitude Analysis

Plot a histogram with KDE for earthquake magnitude distribution.

Categorize magnitudes into bins (e.g. 0–3, 3–5, 5–7, 7+) and count how many events fall in each bin.

Compute the average depth, cdi, and sig for each magnitude category.

Show a scatter plot between magnitude and depth. Add a regression line.

Which range of magnitude is most likely to cause a tsunami? (groupby magnitude bin and take mean of tsunami)

🔹 Temporal Patterns

Count how many earthquakes happened each year and plot a line chart.

Plot the average magnitude per year to see if it’s increasing over time.

Find the month with the highest average magnitude across all years.

Create a bar chart of the number of earthquakes by month (1–12).

Plot a rolling average (3 years) of magnitude to observe trends.

🔹 Spatial Analysis

Create a scatter map (longitude vs latitude) with color = magnitude and size = depth.

Identify the most common latitude and longitude ranges (using binning or hist2d).

Plot a 2D density plot (hexbin or kde) showing where most quakes occur geographically.

Does depth vary by region? Plot depth vs latitude and depth vs longitude to inspect.

Find the average magnitude in each 10-degree latitude band (e.g., -90 to -80, -80 to -70, etc.).

🔹 Tsunami Relationship

What percentage of earthquakes triggered a tsunami?

Compare the average magnitude and depth of tsunami vs non-tsunami events.

Plot boxplots for magnitude and depth, grouped by tsunami (0 vs 1).

Plot the frequency of tsunamis per year as a line chart.

Use a countplot to show how tsunami frequency changes with magnitude category.

🔹 Advanced Insights

Create a pairplot for numerical features (magnitude, depth, sig, cdi, mmi, nst, dmin, gap).

Compute a new risk_score = magnitude * sig / (depth + 1) and analyze top 10 highest-risk events.

Build a multi-plot dashboard (4 subplots) showing:

(a) Magnitude distribution

(b) Yearly event count

(c) Depth vs Magnitude scatter

(d) Correlation heatmap
