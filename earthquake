Load and preview the dataset. Show the first 10 rows and check column data types.

Check for missing values in each column and calculate the percentage of missing data.

Convert Year & Month into a datetime column named date.
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(dict(year=df['Year'], month=df['Month'], day=1))

Get summary statistics (.describe()) for numeric columns like magnitude, depth, cdi, mmi, sig, etc.

Find correlation among numerical features and visualize it using a seaborn heatmap.

Check data range: What are the minimum and maximum values of magnitude, depth, and sig?

Detect outliers in magnitude and depth using a boxplot.

🔹 Magnitude Analysis

Plot a histogram with KDE for earthquake magnitude distribution.

Categorize magnitudes into bins (e.g. 0–3, 3–5, 5–7, 7+) and count how many events fall in each bin.

Compute the average depth, cdi, and sig for each magnitude category.

Show a scatter plot between magnitude and depth. Add a regression line.

Which range of magnitude is most likely to cause a tsunami? (groupby magnitude bin and take mean of tsunami)

🔹 Temporal Patterns

Count how many earthquakes happened each year and plot a line chart.

Plot the average magnitude per year to see if it’s increasing over time.

Find the month with the highest average magnitude across all years.

Create a bar chart of the number of earthquakes by month (1–12).

Plot a rolling average (3 years) of magnitude to observe trends.

🔹 Spatial Analysis

Create a scatter map (longitude vs latitude) with color = magnitude and size = depth.

Identify the most common latitude and longitude ranges (using binning or hist2d).

Plot a 2D density plot (hexbin or kde) showing where most quakes occur geographically.

Does depth vary by region? Plot depth vs latitude and depth vs longitude to inspect.

Find the average magnitude in each 10-degree latitude band (e.g., -90 to -80, -80 to -70, etc.).

🔹 Tsunami Relationship

What percentage of earthquakes triggered a tsunami?

Compare the average magnitude and depth of tsunami vs non-tsunami events.

Plot boxplots for magnitude and depth, grouped by tsunami (0 vs 1).

Plot the frequency of tsunamis per year as a line chart.

Use a countplot to show how tsunami frequency changes with magnitude category.

🔹 Advanced Insights

Create a pairplot for numerical features (magnitude, depth, sig, cdi, mmi, nst, dmin, gap).

Compute a new risk_score = magnitude * sig / (depth + 1) and analyze top 10 highest-risk events.

Build a multi-plot dashboard (4 subplots) showing:

(a) Magnitude distribution

(b) Yearly event count

(c) Depth vs Magnitude scatter

(d) Correlation heatmap

🧩 1. Data Exploration

Load and preview the dataset — display the first 10 rows and column data types.

Check for missing values — confirm the dataset is 100% complete.

Convert Year and Month into a date column and set it as the DataFrame index.

Show summary statistics for all numeric features (.describe() output).

Identify the strongest correlations between predictors and the target tsunami (using df.corr() and sns.heatmap).

🌊 2. Magnitude & Tsunami Relationship

Plot the distribution of earthquake magnitudes (histogram + KDE).

Group earthquakes into bins (6.5–7.0, 7.0–7.5, 7.5–8.0, 8.0–9.1) and count tsunami vs non-tsunami events.

Compute the average tsunami rate per magnitude bin and visualize with a bar chart.

Boxplot of depth across different magnitude categories — are shallow quakes stronger or weaker?

Scatter plot: magnitude vs depth, color-coded by tsunami status (0/1).

📈 3. Temporal Analysis

Plot number of earthquakes per year (line plot).

Plot average magnitude per year — does the trend show increasing seismic activity?

Plot tsunami occurrences per year — are tsunamis increasing over time?

Identify the month(s) with the highest number of tsunami events.

Compare average magnitude and depth by month (use grouped bar chart).

🌐 4. Spatial Insights

Create a scatter map (longitude vs latitude), with color = magnitude, and shape = tsunami presence.

Use a hexbin or kdeplot to visualize global earthquake density (latitude vs longitude).

Calculate average magnitude by latitude bands (e.g., every 10°).

Show a heatmap of earthquake frequency across latitude and longitude grids.

Identify the most tsunami-prone latitudes (group by latitude band, calculate tsunami ratio).

⚙️ 5. Seismic Parameter Analysis

Examine relationships between cdi, mmi, sig, and magnitude using a pairplot.

Find which variable (depth, sig, mmi, or cdi) has the strongest correlation with tsunami occurrence.

Bar chart: Average sig for tsunami vs non-tsunami events — is significance higher in tsunami events?

Scatter plot: sig vs magnitude, colored by tsunami.

Analyze how the number of stations (nst) and azimuthal gap (gap) affect tsunami classification (boxplot or violinplot).

🧮 6. Risk Scoring & Derived Features

Create a risk_score = (magnitude * sig) / (depth + 1) and add it as a new column.

Show the top 10 highest-risk events and visualize them on a scatter map (longitude vs latitude).

Compare average risk_score for tsunami vs non-tsunami events.

Plot risk_score over time (2001–2022) to observe trends.

Create a dashboard of 4 subplots summarizing key insights:

(a) Magnitude distribution

(b) Tsunami vs Non-tsunami counts

(c) Depth vs Magnitude scatter

(d) Correlation heatmap
